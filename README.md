## Features

- **Streamlined Test Case Creation**: Effortlessly create new test cases by providing prompts to an AI-powered system, eliminating the need for manual test case creation.

- **Automated Testing and Deployment**: Upon test case creation, the system automatically pushes and tests the generated file in the specified GitHub branch, ensuring seamless integration into your workflow.

- **Continuous Improvement**: In the event of test failures, the system iteratively regenerates test cases until failure occurs three times consecutively. Once the threshold is reached, the user is promptly notified, allowing for swift action to address the underlying issues.

- **Version Control and History**: Users can conveniently access the history of different versions of test files, empowering them to review past iterations and generate new versions as needed. This feature enhances transparency and facilitates collaboration by providing insights into the evolution of test cases over time.

## Getting Started

To start using Genie, follow these simple steps:

1. **Input Prompts**: Begin by providing prompts to the AI system to generate new test cases.

2. **Select GitHub Branch**: Specify the GitHub branch where the generated test file will be pushed and tested automatically.

3. **Monitor Test Results**: Keep track of test results and receive notifications in case of failures, enabling prompt intervention to maintain the integrity of your codebase.

4. **Access Version History**: Explore the version history of test files to review past iterations and generate new versions as necessary, ensuring continuous improvement and quality assurance.
